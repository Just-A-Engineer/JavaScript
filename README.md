# JavaScript Repository

## Some information about Web Automation Repo
- I am following a course on Udemy about Web Automation using Playwright. I am really enjoying it so far. 
- I have even started to branch out into doing my own things. That's where the playstationTest.spec.js file came from. 
- I thought to myself, *"What could I test, that I would actually use?"* This is what came to mind. 
- I still have some learning to do when it comes to Playwright. But I will be updating this README.md file, as well as the GitHub repo as a whole. 
- Let me know what you think, I would love to hear some feedback on things I might be able to do better.
