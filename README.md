# C# Directory
============================</br>

This is the beginning of what I'm guessing will be a pretty large repo. Just creating some basic stuff right now, but will be expanding into ASP.NET and .NET desktop type work.

## CalculatorCS Repo
============================</br>
- This is one of the first *major* projects I've done in C#. 
- As such, I ran into a few problems. Nothing major, just simple debugging issues. Things like: 
- * Missing a semicolon
- * Misspelling a variable or variable declaration.
- Pretty simple things in my opinion. Also pretty easy to catch. 
- I plan on expanding on this app every once and awhile. As I learn more and more about C#.
